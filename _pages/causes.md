# Sexual selection and local adaptation

Sexual selection and sexual conflict research has increased rapidly in the last few years, showing that sexual selection can promote adaptation, and how sexual conflict can hinder or slow down such adaptation. I study sexual selection and conflict from an ecological perspective. Can sexual selection promote rapid adaptation to gradually changing instead of novel environments? Is pre- or postcopulatory sexual selection more important in promoting local adaptation? Does environmental factors can mediate the strength of sexual selection and sexual conflict? Can sexual conflict prevent local adaptation and how does local adaptation can in return mediate the strength of sexual conflict?

# Sexual selection and species coexistence

Are ecological differences always needed for species to coexist? Most theoretical and empirical studies of species coexistence have focused on how ecological differences underlie coexistence. Yet, a striking feature of many species is that they differ little ecologically, and instead differ primarily in ways that dictate their reproductive success, such as mate choice and mate competition. This suggests that reproductive interactions could be a neglected path towards explaining the mechanisms behind species coexistence. My research is focused in the questions of how reproductive interactions within and between species, such as reproductive interference and sexual conflict, can promote or prevent species coexistence. Moreover, I try to bring an evolutionary perspective asking how the evolutionary history can help us understand which species - and under which conditions - can coexist.
