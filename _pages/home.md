    excerpt: "My focus is in the interactions between sexual selection, local adaptation and community ecology. My research integrates 1) how sexual selection promotes local adaptation, 2) how is sexual selection mediated by ecological factors, such as interspecific interactions, and 3) how does sexual selection and local adaptation promote or inhibit species coexistence. I mainly work with damselflies as they are a really good system to study species coexistence and for their strong sexual selection. However, I often use theoretical models and the odd fruitfly project."
